# ITHINK

## About the project :

**ITHINK** platform represents an open window for the various topics and themes for the modern community to elicit their opinions and reactions. This pillar provides access to public consultations that the structures formulate with regard to policies and programs.

You can submit your **ideas** and suggestions in various political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental fields through this website to assist the stakeholders and decision-makers in envisioning and proposing **solutions** to specific problems of interest to various sectors such as employment, health, social affairs, environment, and other creative ideas that can achieve an added value will be adopted and crystallized in the form of **projects** and **public decisions**.

## In the project :

### Accounts :

it's necessary to own an account in order to access our website. (all your data except your name are not public !)

### Polls :

polls are one of the core elements of the website, as they provide a lot of data that we use to manage the others functions.
you can easily submit your poll to the administration and it will be published as soon as it is reviewed. currently, we have 5 categories for polls :

-   Sports
-   Politics
-   Gaming
-   Music
-   Health

polls are the top element in the home page structure, so you can choose which poll you want to vote on, voting on a poll will result in deleting it so you cant vote again. apart from voting, you can delete the poll that you're not willing to participate and this refresh the page with a new different poll that takes its place.

### Questions :

questions are the second half of our core elements and they are simple.
the main difference between a poll and a question is that a poll has several solutions that you can **choose** from,
on the other hand, a question asks for your particular answer.

like the polls, answering a question will result in deleting it, also deleting a question will result in a new question to answer

### Comments : 

the comment section is where people discuss the topic before deciding as some questions demand a high level of understanding.
you can comment both on the polls and the questions (be nice and respectful as comments can result in serious actions !)

### Data :

one of the core ideas that we aim for is to provide clear statistics on the Tunisian community, as our website can collect and format the data from the database :

- the % of voters' age, sex, place, occupation, orientation, favorite (...) / so we have a clear picture of our intellectual community
- hear the voices of thousands and see their demands through their contributions. 
- based on the % of inputs we can choose the best solutions and confront the stakeholders.
- lastly, offer the user an enjoyable time 


### Suggestions :

we mentioned before that users can submit their polls and questions to the admins to review, and this is done in the suggestions section here. be careful what you send to the review as we will not accept any malicious demand

### Todo list :

we will be publishing our to-do list publicly here as any sort of help is more than welcomed.

1. we are working on a series of tests that result in your profile being certified for trustful contributions, every certified profile in a specific category(sport, health, music ... ) will be supported :

    - his votes and answers are more important in our decisions
    - his comments will be pinned to the top
    - his polls and questions will be badged
    - his reports are reviewed faster

2. we are working on a contact-us section that has many contacts of ours

3. we are working on a follow system to make users follow each other and this will result in :

    - you will receive the polls and questions of the users you follow
    - their comments will be pinned in your polls and questions

4. we are working on a statistics section on the home page

5. we are working on the test cases

6. we are working on a Heroku upload
